### 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm Adam Stogsdill (He/Him). I'm currently a senior at Colorado School of Mines [CSM]. I am a Computer Science major specializing in Robotics and Intelligent Systems. I also am an undergrauate researcher at CSM's [MirrorLab](https://mirrorlab.mines.edu/) under Dr. Tom Williams. I have a very strong interest in machine learning and bioinformatics. Hopefully, after my undergraduate schooling, I will attend a PhD program in bioinformatics or something similar.

### 💻 My Research

I'm currently working on a combination of Robotics and NLG (Natural Language Generation). Currently trying to find a combination of variables that yield a threshold between a person's natrual transition from using deixis to using more abstract gesture types. I'm designing a GAN model that will represent this gesture model and will generate either deictic or abstract gesture animations depending on whether the variables pass the threshold or not.

Read preliminary investigative paper here:
[Investigating Confidence-Based Category Transition of Spatial Gestures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339815123_Investigating_Confidence-Based_Category_Transition_of_Spatial_Gestures)

### 📚 Currently Reading

I'm currently reading, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.
