### 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm Adam Stogsdill (He/Him). I'm a Biotechnical AI/ML Engineer at RAIsonance. 

### 📚 Currently Reading

I'm currently reading, [Principles of Neural Science 6th edition] by Eric R. Kandel, John D. Koester, Sarah H. Mack, Steven A. Siegelbaum. A book on the basics of Neuroscience (and other related fields). I'm very interested in this subject and once I'm done with this hefty book, I'm going to look into books about Computational Neuroscience.
